Project Proposal:
	• Novel
	• Intensive
	• Design
	• Cool shit

Business:
	• File sharing
		○ GitHub to share
			§ Push/pull, version control
			§ .SEQ file upload
		○ Google Drive
	• Slack to talk

PROJECT:
	• Vision: 2 weeks to next meeting; think about 2 projects you want to propose and come with prepared material
	• Vote on proposals
	• Considerations
		○ How novel?
		○ Sequential design code
		○ Zemax preferred
		○ Ask various professors you're connected to
	• Inspiration
		○ Design Group at RIT
		○ Anthony Vela at LLNL 
			§ 3D printed, index-varying optics
		○ Zoom Lenses
			§ Afocal zoom
				□ Minimize pupil walk (aberration)
			§ Python script to generate optimal first-order power solutions
			§ Freeze ray for Megamind
		○ Project submissions to Intl. Design competitions
		○ Bat Signal
			§ Real application, develop specs
	• Want a progress update at the end of the semester showing what PODS is up to

Thoughts:
	• Talk to Koshel about hosting a FRED workshop to introduce folks to stray light analysis
	• Day of knowledge transfer between members of PODS
	• Inviting PODS members to join the 

CubeSat:
	• Optical design trade-study
	• Combo of a couple papers
	• 2018 paper, comparison of objectives for CubeSats
		○ 1 U = 10 cm^3 volume
		○ Propose 3 U CubeSat with 2 U for optics and 1 U avionic, instruments
		○ Build spec out of target
		○ Considered 3 element refractive systems
		○ Freeform, reflective TMA
			§ "Gold leaf on a donut"
		○ Not particularly complex designs, but a lot of them
	• Lots of subdivisions of optical objective
	• Design space mapped to cost function, constrained to CubeSat volume
	• Jaren's advisor knows his shit about CubeSats
	• Could even use Joel's 
	• CREATE: Design space for CubeSat
	• Re: Non-Seq.
		○ Reasonable to assemble in mech software and do stray light
	• Affie's undergrad project is EUV solar telescope on a CubeSat
	• Instrument suites may be explored as well
		○ Mini-spectrographs
		○ Jaren @ JPL
			§ Spectrograph w/ HiRISE resolution (interferometric), optimized for space-based applications
			§ Balanced on his nose in a photo
				□ You should ask to see the photo
				□ It's pretty sick
				□ I'm jelly

Non-Sequential Design : Scatterometer
	• Find a good, high-resolution scatterometer
	• Hard to 
	• Scatter measurement unit 5D CNC system, instead of a goniometer
		○ Current tech uses fibers on goniometer; limiting
		○ 5D CNC would allow for more precise measurement of BSDF and BRDF
	• Joel: Lot's of companies in LIDAR really want to know polarization dependent BSDF, BRDF
		○ Could use polarization-maintaining fibers to enable polarization measurement
		○ Currently, polarization-maintaining fiber at LIDAR wavelengths do not exist
	• Often in LIDAR, output is left hand circular, return right hand circular
	• In LIDAR, don't want specular reflections
		○ There are companies who would kill to see this info
	• May not be primarily focused on sequential modeling
		○ Jaren: worried about the learning curve for non-sequential for everyone

Visible Spectrum Startracker:
	• Sara has worked on this at SpaceMicro
	• Two purposes
		○ High-contrast 4K sensor to look at earth as well as stars
		

OUTREACH IDEA: Corn syrup suspended on water forms a grin lens, which will deflect a laser downwards on a curve
